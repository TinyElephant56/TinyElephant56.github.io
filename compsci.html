            <p><b>Colin Haine</b> is a 16-year-old engineer, programmer, and artist based in California. He
                leads manufacturing for FRC Team 5026, the Iron Panthers, where heâ€™s helped take the team to the 2025
                World Championship while also contributing to projects in animation, scouting automation, and design. A
                self-taught coder with six years of experience, Colin explores topics like computer vision, neural
                networks, and cybersecurity while also developing games, web apps, and interactive media. When he's not
                working on robots or coding, he plays tenor saxophone in his school's jazz band and experiments with
                creative projects that blur the line between tech and art.
